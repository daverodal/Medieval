<span class="big">ZONES OF CONTROL</span>

<p>
    Each unit exerts a Zone Of Control into all of its Frontal Hexes at all times.
    Exception: Non Missile units do not exert Zones of control over impassable terrain.
    Hostile units moving into a unitâ€™s zone of control must stop. Hostile units Retreating or Fleeing into a units Zone of Control must stop and suffer a step loss.
    Units may only Melee attack hostile units in one of their Zones of Control.
    Only certain units may exit a hostile zone of control other than as a result of combat (See Breaking Off above.)
    A unit which exits a hostile zone of control during the frei9ndly movement phase may not enter another hostile zone of control in the same phase.
